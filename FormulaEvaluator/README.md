# Assignment Specific Topics

This assignment deals with stacks and how to implement an algorithm to evaluate arithmetic expressions. 
This solution is currently capable of being able being able to evaluate arithmetic expressions using 
non-negative integers, variables, and operators such as the '(,+,-,*,/,)'. In my code, I have implemented several different 'checks' 
that look at the current token and depending on what kind of token it is, there are specific actions tied to each kind of token. 
The Evaluator class expands more on this and the specific instructions for each check are in the XML method headers and in-line comments.
