# Comments to Evaluators:

I have no comments to evaluators

# Assignment Specific Topics

The informal testing class of this solution is able to test any functionality of the Evaluator class 
because it has a reference to the Evaluator class. There is a main method that calls every small testing method 
to be able to easily see all of my tests in one place and which ones have failed or passed.
